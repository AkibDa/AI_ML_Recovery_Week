# AI_ML_Recovery_Week
This is 1-week AI/ML recovery plan â€” designed to rebuild confidence, reframe my learning, and help me feel the progress I'm making again.

## Day 1

* Tool's I have used so far in my ML journey :
  - Pandas - A library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Numpy - A fundamental library for Python numerical computing.
  - Matplotlib - A open-source plotting library for Python.
  - Scikit-Learn - An open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language.
  - Tensorflow - An open-source framework for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  - Streamlit - A open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps.
    
* Concepts I have touched in Machine learning :
  - Regression - A technique used to capture the relationships between independent and dependent variables.
  - Classification - A supervised learning technique where models learn from labeled datasets to assign new data points to predefined categories or classes.
  - Decision Tree - A type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
  - Random Forest - A machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and stable prediction.
    
* Projects I have made so far :
  - [DiagnoWise](https://github.com/AkibDa/DiagnoWise) - Smart Disease Predicting App
  - [DietForge](https://github.com/AkibDa/DietForge) â€“ Diet planning web app using Flask
  - [Suggestify](https://github.com/AkibDa/Suggestify) â€“ TV show recommender with Gemini API
