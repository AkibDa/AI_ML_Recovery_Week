# AI_ML_Recovery_Week
This is 1-week AI/ML recovery plan — designed to rebuild confidence, reframe my learning, and help me feel the progress I'm making again.

## Day 1

* Tool's I have used so far in my ML journey :
  - **Pandas** - A library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Numpy** - A fundamental library for Python numerical computing.
  - **Matplotlib** - A open-source plotting library for Python.
  - **Scikit-Learn** - An open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language.
  - **Tensorflow** - An open-source framework for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  - **Streamlit** - A open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps.
    
* Concepts I have touched in Machine learning :
  - *Regression* - A technique used to capture the relationships between independent and dependent variables.
  - *Classification* - A supervised learning technique where models learn from labeled datasets to assign new data points to predefined categories or classes.
  - *Decision Tree* - A type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
  - *Random Forest* - A machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and stable prediction.
    
* Projects I have made so far :
  - [DiagnoWise](https://github.com/AkibDa/DiagnoWise) - Smart Disease Predicting App
  - [DietForge](https://github.com/AkibDa/DietForge) – Diet planning web app using Flask
  - [Suggestify](https://github.com/AkibDa/Suggestify) – TV show recommender with Gemini API

## Day 2

**Goal**: *Reinforce fundamentals through tiny wins.*

**Regression_Model.py** : *A Linear Regression model trained on Iris dataset*

**Classification_Model.py** : *A Decision Tree Classifier trained on Iris dataset*

**Clustering_Model.py** : *KMeans Clustering on random 2D points*

## 🔮 What’s Next
- Day 3: Build an end-to-end project using Streamlit
- Day 6: Make the repo portfolio-worthy with deployment
